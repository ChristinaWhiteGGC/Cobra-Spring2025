pyramid where players must explore rooms, solve puzzles, interact with artifacts, and fight monsters.

-Combat Mechanics: Players engage in combat with enemies such as mummies and scorpions using a turn-based combat system.
-Inventory System: Players collect and manage items, weapons, armor, and consumables.
-Navigation System: Players use directional commands (N, E, S, W) to move between rooms, with restricted movement based on locked doors and puzzles.

The player will start in room one and then be prompted for further commands.

The navigation commands are :

N - to go to the room to the North

If there is not a room in the direction chosen OR if the room is locked, the player will be notified
that they can't go that way.

The default map of rooms with connections looks like this:
Note: Once a player has visited every room on a floor, the game will print out the map for
that floor so that the player can more easily navigate to the next floor.
