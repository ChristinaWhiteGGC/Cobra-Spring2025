The player will start in room one and then be prompted for further commands.

The navigation commands are :

Note: Once a player has visited every room on a floor, the game will print out the map for
that floor so that the player can more easily navigate to the next floor.

Some rooms have items and puzzles in them. The player may use the "Explore"
command to get a list of items in the room; if the room has no items,
the player will be told the room doesn't have any items. If the room does have items,
the player may pickup the item and place it in their inventory using
the "Pickup + <item-name>" command. Once the item is picked up the player may
then get a description of the item using the "Inspect + <item-name>" command.
To see a list of items the player has, the player may use the "Inventory" command.
If the player wishes to remove an item from the inventory, the player may do so using
the "Drop + <item-name>" command

If a room contains a puzzle, the puzzle will be displayed to the player immediately
when the player enters that room. The player will be prompted to enter the answer and
will have a specified number of attempts to answer the puzzle. If the player enters an
incorrect answer, the game will subtract 1 attempt from the allowed attempts and the
player will be allowed to answer again until all remaining attempts are used or the
player enters the correct answer. If the player is unable to solve the puzzle correctly
within the allowed number of attempts, the game will notify the player they have failed
to solve the puzzle. The player will then be allowed to continue navigating through the game,
but as soon as the player re-enters the room with the unsolved puzzle, the player will be
required to attempt the puzzle again. If the player solves the puzzle correctly, the puzzle
will be removed from the game.
